      "fullDescription": "This project is a multi-tenant system for SEN schools that unifies student records, school needs, and recurring meeting notes in one place. Educators can quickly surface individual student needs and school-level priorities through fast search and structured tagging. An AI ingestion module lets users import existing student data in various formats, eliminating one-by-one manual entry and improving data consistency. Early traction includes interest from three former school teachers and a collaboration inquiry from Hong Kong company “Evoke AI Lab.” The project is estimated to be valued at ~HKD 100,000+.",

      "fullDescription":"This project is a keyword-driven training chatbot that uses a JSON-based structure to simulate dynamic and context-aware responses. It operates by matching user inputs to categorized patterns such as greetings, education, technologies, projects, hobbies, and more. Each category includes multiple natural-language patterns and a curated list of potential responses, complete with tone ('mood'), tags, and optional follow-up prompts to enhance interactivity. The bot also supports 'easter eggs' — special hidden responses triggered by specific phrases, adding personality and engagement. This modular structure makes it easy to extend with new patterns, responses, or themes, making it suitable for personal portfolio sites or onboarding chatbots. The project showcases skills in natural language pattern recognition, structured data design, and user-centric conversational flow.",
