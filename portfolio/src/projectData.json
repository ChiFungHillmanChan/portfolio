      "fullDescription":"This project is a keyword-driven training chatbot that uses a JSON-based structure to simulate dynamic and context-aware responses. It operates by matching user inputs to categorized patterns such as greetings, education, technologies, projects, hobbies, and more. Each category includes multiple natural-language patterns and a curated list of potential responses, complete with tone ('mood'), tags, and optional follow-up prompts to enhance interactivity. The bot also supports 'easter eggs' — special hidden responses triggered by specific phrases, adding personality and engagement. This modular structure makes it easy to extend with new patterns, responses, or themes, making it suitable for personal portfolio sites or onboarding chatbots. The project showcases skills in natural language pattern recognition, structured data design, and user-centric conversational flow.",
